## üé® Project Description

**NFT Marketplace** is a decentralized web application that allows users to buy, sell, and auction their ERC721 NFTs on the blockchain. Built using modern technologies such as **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Chakra UI**, this platform provides users with the ability to seamlessly manage their NFTs, participate in auctions, and make secure transactions via **smart contracts** on the **Sepolia Test Network**. 

The application is powered by **Alchemy API** to fetch wallet-based NFTs and utilizes **ethers.js** for interacting with blockchain smart contracts. This platform supports **ERC721** NFTs, allowing users to trade and auction their digital assets in a smooth and decentralized manner.

### **My NFTs Page**
The **My NFTs** page allows users to manage their NFT collections directly from their connected wallet. Users can view their **unlisted NFTs**, **NFTs listed for sale**, and **NFTs currently in auction**. Each NFT can be listed for sale or put up for auction directly from this page. If an NFT is already on sale or auction, the user can cancel the listing under the appropriate conditions. The page also includes pagination for ease of use when handling larger collections.

Key features of the **My NFTs** page include:
- **View Unlisted NFTs**: See all your NFTs that are not currently listed for sale or auction.
- **List for Sale**: Set a price and quantity to list NFTs for sale.
- **Start Auction**: Create an auction by setting a start price, start time, and end time.
- **Cancel Sale or Auction**: If needed, cancel ongoing sales or auctions.
- **Pagination**: Easy navigation through large collections.
